      <description>But I wondered how grey? Rochester has some of the greyest skies of all cities in the United States but after 9 years here, this felt like one of the sunniest winters ever. I couldnâ€™t prove it, but I did want to compare the sky colors across months and hopefully see trends over a few years.&#xA;I had remembered previously seeing a NYC sky color website and loved the idea. I wanted to build something similar but for Rochester but also build out a dataset for future comparisons.</description>
